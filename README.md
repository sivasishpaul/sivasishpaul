# Cosmological Packages
**1. CLASS(Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System)**  
* [CLASS](https://github.com/sivasishpaul/class_public.git) is a Boltzmann code that simulate the evolution of linear perturbations in the universe and to compute CMB and large scale structure observables.

**2. Montepython** 
* [Montepython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public.git) is a MCMC sampling package in Python used for parameter inference in cosmology. It contains likelihood codes from the most current investigations and interacts with the Boltzmann code CLASS for computing cosmic observables.

**3. Cobaya** 
* [**Cobaya**](https://github.com/CobayaSampler/cobaya)(**c**ode for **bay**sian **a**nalysis) is a framework for sampling and statistical modelling similar to that of Montepython but with some extra advantage of handling models with intgernal interdependencies.
